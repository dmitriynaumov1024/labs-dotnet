Compute on a thread

function:
S(n) = sum f(i) for i = [0...n] 
f(i) = i^2 / (1 + i^4)

main program input:
- n: Int64 # i limit
- threads: Int32 [1...16] # thread count

main program output:
- sum: Double # sum
- time: Int32 # elapsed time in seconds

sub program input:
- n: Int64 # i limit
- i0: Int64 # i start
- step: Int64 # i step

sub program output:
- sum: Double # sum
