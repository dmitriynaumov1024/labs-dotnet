input: a pbm (P1) file with glyphs
input: a short string 
input: a color

raster glyph is basically a ((2d bit array), (color))
voxel is basically a ((x, y, z), (color)) 
vertex buffer is basically a float[]

(text, color) -> RasterGlyph[] -> Voxel[] -> float[] 

convert that file to dictionary of char to raster glyph
for each 
take raster glyphs
